        "The algorithm works as follows: it analyses each word and its context (by default, the context is 2 word before and 2 words after the given word). As a result, I have a dictionary of words and its neighboring words. When performing autocorrection, each words is given a list of candidates, and then the best candidate is chosen based on its context in the sentence and the learnt context words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Norvig's and my algorithms are very similar because the logic behind them is very similar -- they find the most similar and frequent word from the known vocabulary and replace \"unseen\" words with \"correct\" ones. The idea of my improvement is to make this process more flexible by adding the ability to also consider neighboring words when making this decision (as opposed to simply choosing the most common word).\n",

        "- Context-sensitivity. The model learns the context of each word, and when making predictions, it chooses the candidate with the best context match.\n",
        "- A potential ability to change correct but misused words. Since the model takes the context into account, it may change a misused word into a more appropriate but similar word, for example compare 'you\"re' vs 'your'.\n",
        "\n",
        "The candidates for each word are based on similarity -- Levenshtein distance (for evaluation) and Damerau-Levenshtein distance (for predicting), thus taking into account the mistakes associated with the keyboard layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the biggest downsides is this algorithm doesn't account for missing and extra spaces. Due to this assignment's limitation it is impossible to detect such cases, and iterating through each character and space to test for them is too time consuming.\n",
